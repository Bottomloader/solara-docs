## Submitting Changes (Choose Your Method!)

### Method 1: Easy Edit on GitHub (Great for Small Fixes)

Perfect for typos, wording tweaks, or simple corrections directly in your browser:

1.  **Navigate:** Go to the page on [solara.js.org](https://solara.js.org) where you see the error.
2.  **Find the File:** Look for an "Edit this page" link (if available) OR manually browse the [`docs/` folder](https://github.com/getsolarajs/solara-docs/tree/main/docs) in this repository to find the corresponding `.md` or `.mdx` file.
3.  **Click Edit:** Once you've found the file on GitHub, click the **pencil icon** (‚úèÔ∏è "Edit this file") near the top right of the file view.
4.  **Make Changes:** Edit the text directly in the browser editor.
5.  **Propose Changes:** Scroll down and describe your change clearly in the "Propose changes" section.
6.  **Create Pull Request:** Click "Propose changes". This will automatically fork the repo (if needed) and start a Pull Request for you! Our team will review it.

### Method 2: Local Setup with Git (Better for Larger Changes)

If you're making more complex changes, adding multiple examples, or want to preview locally:

1.  **Fork** this repository (`getsolarajs/solara-docs`) on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/getsolarajs/solara-docs.git`
3.  **Create a Branch:** `git checkout -b fix/my-doc-fix`
4.  **Find & Edit:** Locate the `.md` or `.mdx` file in the `docs/` folder and make your changes.
5.  **(Optional but Recommended) Preview:** Run `npm install` (or `yarn`) then `npm start` (or `yarn start`) to see your changes locally at `http://localhost:3000`.
6.  **Commit & Push:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "docs: Describe your change clearly"
    git push origin fix/my-doc-fix
    ```
7.  **Open a PR:** Go to your fork on GitHub and click "New pull request". Explain your changes clearly.
