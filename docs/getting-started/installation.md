# Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have **Node.js v16.9.0 or higher** installed on your system. This is a requirement for Discord.js v14, which Solara.js relies on.

You can download Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

Once Node.js is set up, you can install Solara.js and its essential peer dependency, Discord.js v14, using your preferred package manager (npm or yarn). Navigate to your project directory in your terminal and run one of the following commands:

```bash title="Using npm"
npm install @getsolara/solara.js discord.js
```

```bash title="Using yarn"
yarn add @getsolara/solara.js discord.js
```

This command installs both the `solara.js` framework and the required version of `discord.js`.

That's it! You're now ready to start building your bot. Head over to the [Your First Bot](./first-bot) guide to get started.
